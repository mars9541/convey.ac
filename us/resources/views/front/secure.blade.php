The CONVEY platform has been built using the 'Data Protection by Design and by Defaultâ€™ principle which means that Data Security and Data Privacy is the central element around which everything else in established. This principle is outlined by article 25 of the GDPR and covers everything from the way that data enters the platform wrapped in an encryption layer (Transport Layer Security) making the data impossible to read whilst in transit, through to record and field encryption, and even the deletion of records upon a successful request.</p>
